# airbnb

This project explores Airbnb prices in San Francisco over several different events.

## Data

Data can be fetched by running the following command on Terminal on macOS/Linux or Git Bash on Windows:

```bash
sh scripts/download.sh
```

This will create a `data` directory that is not included in this Github repository (via [`.gitignore`](./.gitignore)).
